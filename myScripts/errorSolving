## keycodes
#https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Keyboard_input
# their are two types of keycodes 
1] linux keycodes and 2] xorg keycodes
xorgKeycodes = linuxKeycodes + 8
# to get xorg keycodes use "xmodmap -pke"
# to get live keycode when you pressed 
  1] keyboard connected by use cable
  $ sudo evtest
     # select event according to devise
     # then type any key you will get linux keycode 
     # just add 8 to it 
     # you will get xorg keycode
     # you can use this keycode name in i3 config
  2] inbuilt keyboard
   - using virtual console(tty)
     # login to tty 
     # type command 
     $ showkey --keycodes
     # press any key you will get some code
  3] better to use xorg-xev
     xorg-xev
      #press any key this will show xorgKeycodes
      #you can press any key from inbuilt or usb Keyboard 
      #keep in mind that your cursor should be inside white screeen
    - directly use command
     xev | awk -F'[ )]+' '/^KeyPress/ { a[NR+2] } NR in a { printf "%-3s %s\n", $5, $8 }'
     here i came to know fn+F5 of inbuilt keyboard not modified
     also fn+F9 of inbuilt keyboard has no bingidig
     also fn+f8 of inbuilt keyboard has two keys Alt_l+p
     also here they called alt key as super key
     also called window/super key as Alt_l
